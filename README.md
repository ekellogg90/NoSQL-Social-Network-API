## Description
- Motivation: My motivation for making this was to learn how to use a NoSQL database to create and store data that can be accessed via api routes.
- Why: I built this application to further my understanding of MongoDB and the MVC paradigm
- What problem does this solve: This application solves the problem of data connectivity.
- What I learned: Learning how to utilize built in Mongoose methods for use in MongoDB was really interesting.
- Challanges: The biggest challenge I faced was in setting up the friends list and reactions to thoughts inside of the models.
